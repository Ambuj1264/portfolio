                    developers. A person who creates amazing websites for businesses and startups. A full-stack web
                    developer looks after both the front-end and the back-end parts. The front-end deals with how the
                    websites look when delivered to the customers while the back-end stores and processes all the data
                    safely.

                    Also, to bring to your notice, web developers are highly paid professionals. Most Software
                    Developers work as Web Developers.
